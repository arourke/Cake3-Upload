## Requirements
* CakePHP 3.X

## Installation
Run : `composer require xety/cake3-upload:1.*`
Or add it in your `composer.json`:
``` php
"require": {
	"xety/cake3-upload": "1.*"
},
```

## Usage
In your `config/bootstrap.php` add :
``` php
Plugin::load('Xety/Cake3Upload');
```
In your model `initialize()`:
``` php
$this->addBehavior('Xety/Cake3Upload.Upload', [
		'fields' => [
			'avatar' => [
				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5'
			]
		]
	]
);
```
Set your form to accept files
``` php
	$this->Form->create($foo, ['type'=>'file']);
	// .. or ..
	$this->Form->create($foo, ['enctype' => 'multipart/form-data']);
```
To create an input to upload a file, just use the this rule : **fieldName_file**. Example :
``` php
<?= $this->Form->input('avatar_file', ['type' => 'file']) ?>
```
If specified in your Entity, add the suffixed field (e.g. `avatar_file`) to the `$_accessible` array:
``` php
	protected $_accessible = [
		# ..
        	'avatar_field' => true,
        	# ..
        	];
```

### Identifiers
* **:id** Id of the Entity (It can be the user Id if you are using this for the users table for example)
* **:md5** A random and unique identifier with 32 characters. i.e : *bbebb3c3c5e76a46c3dca92c9395ee65*
* **:y** Based on the current year. i.e : *2014*
* **:m** Based on the current month. i.e : *09*
* **:d** Based on the current day. i.e : *02*

#### Field-Based Identifiers
In addition to the above identifiers, you can use any field in the entity by referencing the field's name. For instance, if the table where 'avatar' resides also has a 'username' field you would like to use in your path:
``` php
$this->addBehavior('Upload', [
        'fields' => [
            'avatar' => [
                'path' => 'upload/avatar/:username/:md5'
            ]
        ],
    ]
);
```
Associated data can be accessed in a similar manner, using a parent.child notation. For instance, if 'user' belongsTo 'group' and 'group' has an 'id' you would like to use in your file path:
``` php
$this->addBehavior('Upload', [
        'fields' => [
            'avatar' => [
                'path' => 'upload/avatar/:group.name/:id/:md5'
            ]
        ],
    ]
);
```
Additionally, virtual fields generated by Cake3Upload are also available, including :*field*\_file\.name and :*field*\_file\.name
##### Field Sanitation
Field-based identifiers are santitized prior to being used to ensure that they comply with naming conventions for both Windows and Linux. Anything that not a word, whitespace, or number is replaced with a '-' in the filepath. However, the following special charachters are permitted:
* \-
* \_
* ~
* ,
* ;
* \[\]
* \(\)

Additionally, fields are trimmed to 40 characters, to assure long fields do not prevent the file from saving due to path length limitations.

## Configuration
* ### suffix
    Default : `_file`

    You can change the suffix *_file* to your own suffix :
    ``` php
    $this->addBehavior('Upload', [
    		'fields' => [
    			'avatar' => [
    				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5'
    			]
    		],
    		'suffix' => '_anotherName'
    	]
    );

    <?= $this->Form->input('avatar_anotherName', ['type' => 'file']) ?>
    ```

* ### overwrite
    Default : `true`

    This option allow you to define if the behavior must delete and/or overwrite the old file for the field. **If the option is *false*, the file will be not uploaded if the old file name has the same name as the new name file.** It can be useful if you want your users to upload only one image.
    ``` php
    $this->addBehavior('Upload', [
    		'fields' => [
    			'avatar' => [
    				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5',
                    'overwrite' => false
    			]
    		]
    	]
    );
    ```

* ### defaultFile
    Default : `false`

    This option allow you to defined a default file for the field. It can be useful if you have defined a default avatar for all your new user and you don't want to delete it (i.e : In your database as defaut value for avatar you have set : "../img/default_avatar.png"). **Will work only if the overwrite is defined to *true***.
    ``` php
    $this->addBehavior('Upload', [
    		'fields' => [
    			'avatar' => [
    				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5',
                    'overwrite' => true,
                    'defaultFile' => 'default_avatar.png'
    			]
    		]
    	]
    );
    ```

* ### useFieldIdentifiers
    Default : `true`
    
    If you do not intend to use field based identifiers, set this option to false. This will reduce processing time. the id of the array, if set, is available regardless of this setting.
    ``` php
    $this->addBehavior('Upload', [
    		'fields' => [
    			'avatar' => [
    				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5',
    				'useFieldIdentifiers' => false
    			]
    		]
    	]
    );
    ```

* ### prefix
    Default : `false`

    This option allow you to defined a prefix for your upload path. Useful if you don't want to use the img/ directory for your upload.
    ``` php
    $this->addBehavior('Upload', [
    		'fields' => [
    			'avatar' => [
    				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5',
    				'prefix' => '../'
    			]
    		]
    	]
    );
    ```
    ##### Example :
    If you use a custom directory at the root of the *webroot* directory and you use the `HtmlHelper` to display your image, you can set a prefix like this :
    ``` php
    /**
     * The path will look like this :
     *       webroot/upload/avatar
     *
     * In the database, the record will look like that :
     *      ../upload/avatar/1/bbebb3c3c5e76a46c3dca92c9395ee65.png
     */

    $this->addBehavior('Upload', [
    		'fields' => [
    			'avatar' => [
    				'path' => 'upload/avatar/:id/:md5',
    				'prefix' => '../'
    			]
    		]
    	]
    );

    // In a view, with the Html Helper:
    <?= $this->Html->image($User->avatar) ?>
    // Output : <img src="/img/../upload/avatar/1/bbebb3c3c5e76a46c3dca92c9395ee65.png" alt="">
    ```
